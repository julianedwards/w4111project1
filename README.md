GroupFinder

COMSW4111 Project 1      

GroupFinder is a web application that connects people to interest groups,
varying from pickup soccer leagues to knitting clubs in the New York City 
area. Users have the ability to create and join groups of their interest and 
post about events happening in the city, related to an interest of theirs. 
Established businesses (outside groups) related to an interest, such as yoga 
studios or fitness centers will have postings about their classes on the web 
application. The purpose of GroupFinder is to help users get involved in 
activities of their interests easily without having to know friends beforehand;
this application will be especially useful to people moving into the city or 
those with newly found hobbies.
